This is my neovim setup. 

This setup is inspired by typecraft's youtube series for neovim for newbs.

I have tried to get the basic setup and I am done with this.

I am still using VSCode for my main text editor but hope to switch to NeoVim one day in future. 

May also have a complete different setup in future.
